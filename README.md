# Gold-Price-Prediction-Project
We are interested in discovering the nature of the relationship between the price of gold, silver, oil and euro against dollar and whether knowing them could lead us to predict the price of gold. 

This project  contains the description of the data set, a correlation between a set of features, training different models to predict the price of gold, and finally comparing the performance of all models by calculating the error value for each model.

in this project, i tried three different learning models which are :
  1- Linear Regression
  2- Random Forest Regressor
  3- and Polynomial Feature.
